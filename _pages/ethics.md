## Privacy

The website doesn’t collect personal data, it doesn’t run analytics software, it doesn’t have ads, affiliate links or tracking. Unless you [tell me](/contact/), I have no way to know you've been here.

A full [content security policy](/blog/content-security-policy/) have been implemented.

## Brutalist design

I fully subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

A minimalist at heart, I've been fighting against bloatware since I can remember, therefore this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. I don't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos. I [only use imagery when necessary](/blog/degrowth/).

## Platform

The site is developed from scratch using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment. The code, whether dynamic or static, is handwritten and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/simonesilvestroni/ssil-website).

Moving away from WordPress was to me yet another way of [fighting webwaste](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/biased-ai/#webwaste). A weight comparison between my previous and current website shows an impressive reduction of **97%**.

<div class="table-responsive my-4">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center">Old site (WordPress)</th>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center">New site</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>673.5 MB</code> (files) + <code>67.2 MB</code> (database)</td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>24 MB</code> (full deployment)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Decentralization

The website is now part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), therefore it’s capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting other people’s posts on their websites.

## Small web

These decisions are a consequence of me leaving social media in 2020. Being part of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) is way more in line with how I see the internet and communication in general.

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and ‘convert’. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.<cite>—&nbsp;Parimal Satyal</cite>
