<mark>{{ page.replytouser }}</mark> I really really love this post. I too have always been obsessed with productivity: in my case it stems from a necessity to optimize time and energy. Having such eclectic workflows, things must proceed  smoothly to overcome potential blockers and avoid frustrations. It feels more like a neurodiverse effort to cope with these issues. 

I very much related to your video games example: having worked to a console title for 5 years it’s baffling to hear these comments from productivity junkies. That time, which was also filled with slack and fun, is in my personal top three moments in life where I’d been more creative and *productive* at the same time.
