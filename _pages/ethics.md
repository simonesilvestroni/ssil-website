## Privacy

The website doesn’t collect personal data, it doesn’t run analytics software, it doesn’t have ads, affiliate links or tracking. Unless you [tell me](/contact/), I have no way to know you've been here.

A full [content security policy](/blog/content-security-policy/) have been implemented.

## Design

I fully subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

A minimalist at heart, I've been fighting against bloatware since I can remember, therefore this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. I don't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos. I [only use imagery when necessary](/blog/degrowth/).

## Website architecture

Moving away from WordPress was to me yet another way of [fighting webwaste](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/biased-ai/#webwaste). A weight comparison between my previous and current website shows an impressive reduction of **724MB**.

<div class="table-responsive my-4">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center">Old site (WordPress)</th>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center">New site</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>673.5 MB</code> (files) + <code>67.2 MB</code> (database)</td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>16.5 MB</code> (deployment + source code)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Decentralization

The website is now part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), therefore it’s capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting other people’s posts on their websites.

## Small web

These decisions are a consequence of me leaving social media in 2020. Being part of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) is way more in line with how I see the internet and communication in general.

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and ‘convert’. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.<cite>—&nbsp;Parimal Satyal</cite>

## Tools

Ever since I stopped being attached to a particular brand, becoming <strong>system agnostic</strong> has become second nature.

### Operating systems

Pretty much all the software I use, with few and rare exceptions, can be installed and run from either macOS, Windows or Linux.

### Subscriptions

Brilliant examples are [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/), makers of _Reaper_, and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/), makers of _Sublime Text_: they're small but solid entities that can move swiftly when needed, with a well-thought business model that doesn’t rip off customers. I’m more than happy to support by buying and upgrading their products, because I know I’ll be listened to. None of them have a marketing department shoving ads to everywhere.

For the same reasons, I strictly refuse to use Adobe and Avid's products, along with pretty much everything that is locked within a _subscription model_.

### Walled gardens

I don't subscribe to any _echosystem_. Neither Apple's nor Google or Microsoft. I use open source software to sync my diverse devices. Albeit slightly less convenient, it allows freedom to move around as I please.

### Updates

I’m opposed to updates _for the sake of it_. It means I only follow security updates, bug fixes and actual new useful features.

At the same time, I stopped caring for all Apple updates ever since they had chosen an insane and arbitrarily idiotic yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. **Planned obsolescence** brought by multi-trillion-dollar companies is not my cup of tea.
