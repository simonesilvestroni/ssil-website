The focus of the brief was to re-design UniCredit’s existing online landing pages for new customer acquisitions. We designed and developed a fully responsive site with custom experiences for smartphone, tablet and desktop to replace the existing desktop-only landing pages.

We used our custom responsive framework and [new workflow]({{ site.url }}/a-modern-workflow-for-the-multi-device-web/) to build PHP modules and add **progressive enhancement** functionality through Javascript on top of our designer's vision. The landing pages converted leads connecting to UniCredit's acquisition forms.

Thanks to UI Farm’s approach, we have been able to significantly improve the experience delivered to our customers and prospects, and make changes that may have seemed minor to us but have resulted in significant conversion lifts. UI Farm has truly changed our approach to Interaction Design.
