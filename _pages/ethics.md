## Privacy

The website doesn’t collect personal data, it doesn’t run analytics software, it doesn’t have ads, affiliate links or tracking. Unless you [tell me](/contact/), I have no way to know you've been here.

A full [content security policy](/blog/content-security-policy/) have been implemented.

## Design

I fully subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, fighting against bloatware means that this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. It doesn't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos. I [only use imagery when necessary](/blog/degrowth/).

## Website architecture

By adopting a static web generator as the dynamic engine for a static website, I [fight webwaste](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/biased-ai/#webwaste). Compared to the previous version, the website saw an impressive reduction of **724MB** in size.

<div class="table-responsive my-4">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center">Old site (WordPress)</th>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center">New site</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>673.5 MB</code> (files) + <code>67.2 MB</code> (database)</td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>16.5 MB</code> (deployment + source code)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Decentralization

The website is part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), therefore it’s capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting other people’s posts on their websites.

## Small web

I'm not on mainstream social media. I used to be on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit. That's all gone now, since 2020. Being part of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) is way more in line with how I see the internet and communication in general.

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and ‘convert’. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.<cite>—&nbsp;Parimal Satyal</cite>

## Tools

After stopping being attached to a particular brand, becoming _system agnostic_ has become second nature.

Pretty much all the software I use, with few and rare exceptions, can be installed and run from any operating system.

I don't use illegal software.

## Subscriptions and walled gardens

Everything that is locked within a _subscription model_ doesn't get neither attention nor money from me. Similarly, I don't subscribe to any _ecosystem_. Albeit slightly less convenient, it allows freedom to move around.

The business model that interests us have brilliant examples such as [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/), makers of _Reaper_, and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/), makers of _Sublime Text_: small but solid entities that can move swiftly when needed, with a well-thought model that doesn’t rip off customers. 

We're more than happy to support by buying and upgrading their products, because we'll be listened to. None of them have a marketing department shoving ads everywhere.

### Updates

I’m opposed to updates _for the sake of it_. It means I only follow security updates, bug fixes and actual new useful features.

At the same time, I stopped caring for all Apple updates ever since they had chosen an insane and arbitrary yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. That's part of their _planned obsolescence_ and therefore can stay out.
