description: 'A web designer for two decades between Italy and the UK.'
excerpt: 'In the early 1990s, I started a side job in the publishing industry while graduating as a professional musician. A decade later I learned web design, fascinated by code as a digital evolution of my past experience with the printed page.'

As a web designer, in line with my origins, I still <em>strive for minimalism</em>. With a vast experience in front-end development and some back-end, UI design and custom WordPress systems, my main focus is on accessibility and sustainability through a relentless stack optimization.

I also have a parallel career in audio as a professional musician, producer and game sound designer that I carry out under the moniker _Minutes to Midnight_.

## Other interests

An avid reader, I follow recent tech trends through online media, Mastodon, workshops and newsletters. Trivia: I have a longstanding ~~obsession~~ fascination for typography.

Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, I ended up writing an ebook about [project management](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/projects/project-management/).

## About the website

I've been managing all my activies under the moniker _Minutes to Midnight_ — the name I'd trademarked in the UK in 2017. As a consequence of the decision to split audio and web work, I bought my personal domain and moved the web design related content in here.

The website has been developed from scratch using:

- [Jekyll 4.2.1](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Markdown (extended)](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- Vanilla javascript for [search module](https://github.com/daviddarnes/jekyll-search-js) and [webmentions](http://beesbuzz.biz)
- Table of contents Liquid code by [Vladimir "allejo" Jimenez](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc)
- Bash for building purposes
- [Github](https://github.com/simonesilvestroni/ssil-website)
- [Mona Sans font](https://github.com/github/mona-sans)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

I [do not request third-party resources](https://aremythirdpartiesgreen.com/test/76e7ac7370d84f1fabd254608e118ff4), except for the blog posts, which are calling `webmention.io` to render web mentions.
