## Skills

{: .list-hr }
- I've been crafting websites using code editors with <mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark> since 1998, adopting dynamic languages such as <mark>PHP</mark> and Shopify's <mark>Liquid</mark> template system to handle the logic and generate the markup, and <mark>SASS</mark> for stylesheets.
- Been using <mark>WordPress</mark> as my <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> of choice since version 1.5, building custom themes and plug-ins. I recently adopted <mark>Jamstack</mark> and the static site generator <mark>Jekyll</mark> for my recent projects, which I use with or without an headless CMS.
- I can set up, run and maintain local and remote web servers running <mark>Apache</mark> and <mark>MySQL</mark> either through a GUI or <mark><abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr></mark>.
- Well versed in graphic tools such as <mark>Sketch</mark>, <mark>Figma</mark> and more, as well as graphic suites like <mark>Adobe</mark>.
- My code editor of choice is the cross-platform <mark>Sublime Text</mark>, using <mark>git</mark> as the preferred versioning system.
- I make a point of putting <mark>performance</mark>, <mark>usability</mark> and <mark>sustainability</mark> at the forefront.
- I sparsely use <mark>Javascript</mark>, and I'm against its _abuse_ in modern web development, when web standards can perform the same functionality.
